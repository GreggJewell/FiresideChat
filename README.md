# Fireside Chat
**Fireside Chat: Just Plug Inn**

A lightweight third-party chat application for Hearthstone.

*Only 1 File to Download. No installation required. No Signup required. No setup required.*

**How It Works**

* Download the Fireside Chat application (currently for Windows only).
* Open Hearthstone and the Fireside Chat application, in any order.
* The Fireside Chat application will check for and configure a Hearthstone log file if one doesn't already exist.
* Start playing a game, the chat will automatically place you in a chat room with your opponent. If you don't see your opponent also enter the chat room, that means they don't have the Fireside Chat application running.

* Block/unblock your current opponent's messages in the chat room.
* Filter/unfilter "naughty words" for all chat rooms.
