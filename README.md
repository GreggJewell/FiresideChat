**Fireside Chat: Just Plug Inn**

A lightweight third-party chat application for Hearthstone.

*One file to download. No installation is required. No registration is required. No setup is required. No logs are stored.*

**How It Works**

* Download the Fireside Chat application (currently for Windows only).
* Open Hearthstone and the Fireside Chat application, in any order.
* The application will check for and configure a Hearthstone log file if one doesn't already exist.
* Whenever you start a new game, the application will automatically place you in a unique chat room with your opponent. If you don't see your opponent also enter the chat room, that means they don't have this application running.

**Features**

* You can resize the application to any size you want.
* There is a small menu in the upper-right corner with options to:
   * Filter/unfilter profanity for all chat rooms.
   * Block/unblock your current opponent's messages in the chat room.
   * Copy your current opponent's BattleTag to your clipboard.
* Every user message is removed from the server after 5 minutes, status messages (that only you can see) are removed after 1 minute.
