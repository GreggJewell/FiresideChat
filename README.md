# Fireside Chat
Fireside Chat - A lite third-party chat application for Hearthstone.

How It Works

* Download the Fireside Chat application (currently for Windows only).
* Open Hearthstone and the Fireside Chat application, in any order.
* The Fireside Chat application should automatically check for and configure a Hearthstone log file if one doesn't already exist.
* Start playing a game, the chat will automatically enter you in a room with your opponent. If you don't see your opponent also enter the room, that means they don't have this application.
* Messages are temporarily stored, they're removed from the server after 5 minutes.
